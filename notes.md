"I think the best online events don’t try to recreate the past, but start with a different experience" -- [Linda Liukas](https://medium.com/@lindaliukas/experiments-with-online-events-13b422c9d5fa).

Online events need to be different.
The one thing I feel is missing from that article though is how to enable this way of producing content for online events when one does not have the high-end equipment,
a fast internet connection or experience with video editing.

After reading [A Guide to Starting a Daily Writing Practice](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html)
(after [my colleague Ryan blogged about it](https://blog.harterrt.com/notebook/2020-06-16.html)) I considered doing the same.
I immediately started to build my own little note taking tool.
But I have this blog. It's easy to use, so why build it new?
