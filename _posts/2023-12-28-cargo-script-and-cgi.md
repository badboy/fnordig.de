Everything old is new again.
These days things get deployed as Cloud Functions, Lambdas or whatever [FaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service) it is today.
But those from the old days [simply stuck with CGI](https://rednafi.com/go/reminiscing_cgi_scripts/).

Modern[^1] Rust is perfect for that kind of world!
Cargo now has support for single-file packages ([RFC 3424]),
which allows you to stuff all your code into a single `.rs` file and then run that.
It even caches the built binary, so it's efficient enough to run on every request.

I went ahead and updated the [cgi] crate ([my fork here][cgi-fork]).
Now all it takes is this little bit of Rust code:

````rust
#!/usr/bin/env -S cargo +nightly -q -Zscript
```cargo
[dependencies]
cgi2 = "0.7"
```

#[cgi::main]
fn main(_request: cgi::Request) -> cgi::Response {
    cgi::text_response(200, "Hello World!")
}
````

Install the [fcgiwrap] tool, follow the instructions to configure Nginx and voil√†:
<https://fnordig.de/cgi-bin/hello-world.rs>

Need some state? Throw in a database and you can keep track of that too:
<https://fnordig.de/cgi-bin/counter.rs>
The source code is [available in a Gist][gist]. That's barely 50 lines (plus dependencies).

Go deploy some cloud functions ... I mean lambdas ... I mean CGI scripts!
