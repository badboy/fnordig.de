From end of last year to July this year I wrote my master thesis titled "Network Function Offloading in Virtualized Environments".
I [blogged about the process before](/2017/07/09/how-to-write-a-master-thesis/index.html).
A couple of weeks ago I received my final grade and thus reached the academic degree of Master of Science, Computer Sciene.

This also means I can now make the thesis public:

[Network Function Offloading in Virtualized Environments](https://tmp.fnordig.de/uni/master-thesis/nf-offloading-in-virtualized-environments_jan-erik_rediger.pdf) (PDF)

If you have questions regarding anything in that thesis, contact me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/badboy_) or [via email](mailto:janerik@fnordig.de).
