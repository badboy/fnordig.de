Friday and Saturday I attended [gitmerge][homepage], a free Git user conference
in Berlin.

Friday was filled with lots of lightning talks with lots of interesting ideas,
projects and stories. I tried to collect most of the projects or slides in a
[link list on pinboard][linklist]. More info about each project can be found in
the git repo from the [userday][].

Saturday was planned as [hackday][]. [@mislav][] wanted to improve [hub][], a
wrapper for git. He listed the planned features in [ticket #1][hubplan]. I
tried to help with that, but most mentioned issues were a little over my head
without ever have looked at the source. After a lot of code reading I could
atleast [fix a little bug][pr327] and comment on another issue.

To wrap things up, git merge was a nice little conference, showing off
interesting projects and ideas and I had a few little talks with nice people.

(Oh, and of course visiting Berlin is always nice)
