[Back in 2018 I handed over maintenance for various (hi)redis projects](/2018/08/21/state-of-maintenance-hiredis/) to different people.
I retained access to some repositories and packages, but purely out of caution.

I recently added [Chayim aka cisk](https://pypi.org/user/cisk/) as a maintainer to the [PyPi project](https://pypi.org/project/hiredis/).
They work at Redis Ltd. and thus already have access to the repository regardless.
The plan is to also add [Illia Volochii](https://github.com/illia-v) as a maintainer for hiredis-py next.
My access to the package will be dropped at some point.
I already have only limited access on the repository.
