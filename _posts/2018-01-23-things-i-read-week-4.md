This post is part of a [new experiment this year](/2018/01/08/things-i-read-week-2/index.html):
Trying to briefly collect articles/posts/code/documentation I read in the past week and add some comments for things I consider important.

### Article: [An epic treatise on scheduling, bug tracking, and triage](https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201712)

[apenwarr](https://apenwarr.ca/log/) put a talk on various project management troubles into writing.
He catches a lot of different points on how his or other teams dealt with the increasing amount of bugs, feature development and releases.
He underlines his arguments with simulations of development processes and gives some tips on issue tracker management to deal with bug triage and prioritization.
Lots of good stuff in there.

### Article: [Why dolphins are deep thinkers](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/research.science)

Dolphins don't deserve us humans.
Turns out Dolphins are really really smart and able to easily adopt to changing conditions and apply learned things.

### Article (German): [Der Nicht-Zauber der Sondierung](http://www.markus-barth.de/blog/der-nicht-zauber-der-sondierung.html)

Short post by Markus Barth, author and comedian, on the current political situation in Germany without an elected government, but coalition negations ahdead of us.
I tend to not get to involved in everyday politics at the moment and this articles sums up some of the thoughts I have as well.
