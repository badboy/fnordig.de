Last night I had an idea, which made me stay up two hours longer than I wanted.
I built a useless tool: [lysbilder](https://github.com/badboy/lysbilder/), the slide system no one needed.

Today I tweeted about it and then went out to enjoy the day a bit:

I might have built a very useless slideshow tool on top of rustdoc, generated from code documentation, linked by trait implementations.

Quickly I got some responses:

> I laughed. It was good enough to retweet just because of that.

and

> i love this so much

Those made me smile and made my sunday a bit better. :)
