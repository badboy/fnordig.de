This post is part of a [new experiment this year](/2018/01/08/things-i-read-week-2/index.html):
Trying to briefly collect articles/posts/code/documentation I read in the past week and add some comments for things I consider important.

### Video: [DOOM - Behind the music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4FNBMZsqrY)

> Change the process, change the outcome


Not so much _read_, but watched.
A super entertaining talk by [Nick Gordon](https://twitter.com/Nick_Gordon) explaining the process of the making of the DOOM soundtrack.
I have no idea about audio engineering or musical creativity, but I still enjoyed this talk a lot.

### Paper: [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)

One half of the recent [CPU Exploitation desaster](https://meltdownattack.com/).
The paper is not even that complex and in a scientific way keeps repeating itself.
It clearly lays out the simple instruction sequence that's necessary to trigger the exploitable behaviour.
Quite a nice addition to the [explanations by Google's Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.de/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html).
