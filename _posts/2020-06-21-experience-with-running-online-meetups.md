Since the mid of March (that's now 3 months ago) I ran 9 [meetups](https://berline.rs/) (and [half a conference](https://oxidizeconf.com/oxidize-1k/)) online.
I've also been exploring the technology and concepts to run [a full online conference](https://blog.rustfest.eu/announcing-rustfest-2020).

I promised to write about it.
But I also realized that I'll never finish that if I want it to come out as a properly edited blog post.

So instead I'm going for a more rough experience: A repository with my notes oon the [Experience with running online meetups](https://github.com/badboy/online-meetups).
It's still in progress.
