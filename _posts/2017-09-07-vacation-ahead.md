After finishing [my master thesis](https://fnordig.de/2017/07/09/how-to-write-a-master-thesis/index.html) back in July and a busy Summer working,
I will now spent the next weeks in South America.
That means I won't spend time on open source projects, answering emails or otherwise online (except occasional [tweets](http://twitter.com/badboy_/) and of course [lots of photos](https://www.instagram.com/janerikr)).

Once I am back from vacation, you can catch me talking about WebAssembly at the [JS Kongress Munich](https://2017.js-kongress.de/sessions/webassembly-rest-us/),
meet me in Berlin for [GOTO Berlin](https://gotober.com/) or drop by in [Cologne for some Rust](http://rust.cologne/).

See you in November!
