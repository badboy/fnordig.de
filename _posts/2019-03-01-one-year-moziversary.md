At this day last year I walked into the [Mozilla Berlin](https://blog.mozilla.org/berlin/) office to start my first day of work.
365 days later, today is my very first [#moziversary](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=moziversary).

I joined the Firefox Telemetry Team, now consisting of [:chutten](https://chuttenblog.wordpress.com/), :Dexter, :gfritzsche, :travis\_ (he joined us in November) and me.

Since I joined I:

* visited 5 of the Mozilla Offices (Berlin, Paris, London, Mountain View, San Francisco)
* hosted 2 Rust All-Hands in the Berlin office
* attended 2 Mozilla All-Hands
* had a work week with my team
* hosted regular [Rust Hack'n'Learns](https://berline.rs/2019/03/06/rust-hack-and-learn.html) in the office's Community Space (every second Wednesday!)
* commented on over 250 Bugzilla bugs (about 800 comments apparently)
* were assigned to and closed over 100 bugs
* became a [Telemetry peer](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Toolkit#Telemetry)
* broke Firefox and Firefox for Android once or twice
* read a dozen or so internal project proposals
* had an uncountable number of meetings (yes, meetings _can_ be fun & useful)
* delivered [crucial new features for Telemetry in Firefox](/2019/01/22/multi-store-custom-telemetry-with-shared-data/)
* wrote far more SQL than I thought this job would involve
* move twice inside Berlin

... and probably lots of other stuff I forgot.

The next projects for Firefox Telemetry are already in progress or about to start,
[mobile Telemetry](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/tree/master/components/service/glean) is progressing quickly
and, while I haven't written code for the current implementation, I hope to talk more about that soon.

To the next year and beyond!

## Thank you

First and foremost of course a big **THANK YOU** to my team.
It's been *fun* working along you.  
Another big thank you to everyone in the Mozilla Berlin office, it's always a pleasure to come to the office.
And of course thank you for everyone I worked with so far at Mozilla.
