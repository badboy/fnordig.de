This post is part of a [new experiment this year](/2018/01/08/things-i-read-week-2/index.html):
Trying to briefly collect articles/posts/code/documentation I read in the past week and add some comments for things I consider important.

### Blog post: [Why OpenStreetMap is in Serious Trouble](https://blog.emacsen.net/blog/2018/02/16/osm-is-in-trouble/)

Emacsen, a long-term OpenStreetMap contributor, lays out why the OpenStreetMap project is falling apart and what the project needs to change about its approach, its technology and tooling to make it a long-term successful and viable project.
I am a user of OpenStreetMap data, rely on [its geocoder](https://github.com/badboy/geoplaces) and would very much like it to exist in the future and provide an open data set of geo data.
From that post though OpenStreetMap's future looks more than uncertain. I hope they can pull it around and work on their shortcomings.

### Documentation: [Mercurial for Git users](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/GitConcepts)

As prepartion for my [new job](/2018/02/18/a-new-job/) I installed Mercurial (`hg`) and played around with it.
The linked documentation compares Git (what I used for the past 5 years) to Mercurial.
Seems there are quite a few similarities and it shouldn't be too hard to get comfortable with it.
