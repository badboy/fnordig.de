title: swap in double-linked lists

Yesterday I had to implement [Selection Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
for double-linked lists and I had some trouble finding the correct solution
when it comes to swapping two elements.

But I finally figured out how to correctly swap the pointers and I'll drop the
code here so others can use it (or even tell me about hidden bugs)

I implemented it in Java, so see here:
